In 2018 I had the opportunity to take part in the PISTON field campaign funded by the Office of Naval Research. This included working on a research ship for over a month in the West Pacific collecting ocean and atmosphere observations.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
