Then the forecasts shifted to average or slightly above average as the season began depending on average. So what changed?</p> <p>Over the last few years we have had La Nina conditions. During La Nina equatorial ocean water in the Pacific are cooler than normal. The result tends to be a more active Atlantic hurricane season due to a reduction in vertical wind shear (see 2020). Hurricanes can strengthen quickly when there is no vertical wind shear and all other conditions are favorable.</p> <p>So during an El Nino when the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is above normal, we would expect to see less hurricanes in the Atlantic due to stronger than average vertical wind shear. So why are we expecting more Atlantic hurricanes in 2023 instead of less?</p> <p>The reason is because the sea surface temperature in the Atlantic is hotter than normal over a large area. Hurricanes need warm ocean waters to form, and the hotter the water, the stronger they can get. So the El Nino and warm SST are working against each other and almost balancing out.</p> <p>Since the Atlantic is a large basin, strong vertical wind shear doesnâ€™t always cover the entire basin. Warmer SST over a larger area means that hurricanes can form over a larger area. And this is how we get towards a slightly above average season in the Atlantic.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ENSO"/><category term="Hurricanes"/><category term="comments"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a normal ENSO]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://btrabing.github.io/TrabingWx/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://btrabing.github.io/TrabingWx/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://btrabing.github.io/TrabingWx/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
