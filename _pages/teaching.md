I have a passion for teaching but have not yet had the opportunity to teach a complete course. However, I have been a teaching assistant for a number of classes and have lectured in a number of sessions. Most of my interactions with students have been through one-on-one interactions during office hours and tutoring. I am actively exploring opportunities to teach college-level atmospheric science classes.
