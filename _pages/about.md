I am an Associate Scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) working remotely for the National Hurricane Center. I got my M.S. and Ph.D. in atmospheric science from Colorado State University and a B.S. in meteorology from the University of Oklahoma. I have a passion for both learning and teaching about the weather. My research interests include tropical meteorology, tropical cyclones, lightning, mesoscale meteorology, and radiation. My goal is to improve forecasts of tropical cyclone hazards and I am actively working on a number of projects to better communicate tropical cyclone intensity forecasts and provide storm surge forecasts to new areas around the world.
