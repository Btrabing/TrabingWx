I am an Associate Scientist at UCAR working for the National Hurricane Center. I got my PhD in atmospheric science from Colorado State University and have a passion for both learning and teaching about the weather. My research interests include tropical meteorology, tropical cyclones, lightning, mesoscale meteorology, and radiation. My goal is to improve forecasts of tropical cyclones hazards and I am actively working on a number of projects to better communicate tropical cyclone intensity forecasts and provide storm surge forecasts to new areas around the world.
