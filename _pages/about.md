I am an Associate Scientist at UCAR working for the National Hurricane Center. I got my PhD in atmospheric science from Colorado State University and have a passion for learning more about our weather. My research interests include tropical meteorology, tropical cyclones, lightning, mesoscale meteorology, and radiation.
